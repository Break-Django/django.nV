## Vulnerability - A1 Injection
In views.py upload function there a form upload. However it directly executes SQL commands.
```
            curs = connection.cursor()
            curs.execute(
                "insert into taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') values ('%s','%s',%s)" %
                (name, upload_path, project_id))
```

## Repair
Since the above code excutes directly, to fix the vulnerability we can use the orm to make sure the data passed it cleaned.
We replace the above code with
```
            file = File(
            name = name,
            path = upload_path,
            project = proj
            )
            file.save()
```

This uses django's SQL ORM.
